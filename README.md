Introducing the e-SPBT (Electronic School Textbook Management) System:

Designed and developed single-handedly, the e-SPBT system is a testament to innovation in textbook management tailored specifically for primary and secondary schools. With a core objective of streamlining operations, minimizing textbook losses, and providing insights into student borrowing eligibility, this project embodies efficiency and effectiveness. The system was developed in the year 2021.

Crafted using Visual Studio and powered by XAMPP for seamless database access, e-SPBT utilizes MySQL and C++ programming language to deliver a robust and intuitive platform.

Key Features:
1. Streamlined Textbook Management: Simplifies textbook management processes for administrators and staff, ensuring efficient access and tracking.
2. Loss Prevention: Through meticulous tracking and monitoring, the system significantly reduces instances of lost textbooks, optimizing resource allocation.
3. Student Borrowing Eligibility: Empowers administrators to track student borrowing history, enabling informed decisions regarding eligibility for the upcoming academic year.

Technical Details:
- Leveraged MySQL for efficient database management.
- Developed using C++ programming language for reliability and performance.
- Organized with .h header files containing variable, constant, and function declarations, while .cpp files serve as the source code for application functionality.

As the sole creator of this innovative solution, I invite you to experience the benefits of e-SPBT by executing the provided e-SPBT workshop1.cpp file. Join me in revolutionizing textbook management for schools.
